IESIM: simulating communities using a game-like approach

I worked in many projects so I chosen the most fun

What is the idea behind IESIM?

2
IESIM ADL
- Modelling Environment, that implements models through a set of plugins.
- Targets: programmers and users.
- Intuitive and easy to use, as a computer game!
- Cope with lack of data, creating fictitious scenarios (as in games!)

To demonstrate better its potentialities we implemented a case study.

3
Case Study: outbreakP2P
- Package built using Iesim ADL.
- Simulates the spreading of a non-vector infectious disease.
-Split into three sub-models: community, hazard and intervention.
- Each sub-model is implemented in a separate plugin: ICom, IHaz and IInt.

Each plugin is loaded at run-time and appears as an icon, which gives access to a set of sub-menus to configure the different model parameters.

So what are the models behind?

First Some background

Approaches in Epidemic Modelling: “Top down” and “Bottom-up”.

Mixed Agent-based/Network approach.

6
Community
Agents and “Exposure” or “Mixing”environments (ME).
Agents: households.
ME: functional networks that link the households together. 

7
ME considered in this model: workplaces, schools (others...).
During the configuration, the user loads/generates this information and aggregates the households around the ME.

During the configuration, the user loads/generates this information and aggregates the households around the ME.

Let us see how it works.

8.
step 1.
Load population data from a Shapefile

load_population

9
step 2.
Use aggregated data to generate households with a certain structure: Pert Distribution.

generate_households

10
step 3
Create ME: load them, generate them randomly or input them in the map.
A buffer is used, to aggregate the households around the ME.

generate_workplaces1

what about time?

11
(TODO: review the slide)

Setting the time dynamics of the ME.
Calendar control: a user friendly UI for a complex task.

12
Hazard

Hazard: infectious disease.
SEIR model: susceptible, latent, infectious and Removed.

seir.png

Latent Period: symptomatic and asymptomatic periods.

13
Control for configuring the time dynamics.

14
Attack rate (β) and Illness/Impact rate: Pert Distribution

15
Locate the source of the hazard: known locations of infected individuals.
Load, generate or input.
