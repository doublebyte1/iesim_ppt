The abstract presents an interesting perpective on the spread of disease with an innovative approach to 
methodology

 

It is not quite clear to this reviewer whether the research intends to focus on the methodology in the 
model or the results produced by the model and this should be clarified. Perhaps the use of a focus 
question in the abstract could accomplish this. It would be useful to extend the foundation research 
into the different types of networks that more accurately represent social structure, as the authors 
correctly identify (eg see Jennifer Badham?s work). There needs to be a broader sourcing of reference 
material particularly in the social network aspects of the study ? this area is very sparse (authors 
Scott; Knoke; Wasserman; Valente and others are useful here). Work on diffusion in social networks would 
also support this study. Further extension to the model could include cognitive aspects of the agents in 
the ABM.
